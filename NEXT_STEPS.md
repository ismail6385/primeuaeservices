## 🎯 **Priority 1: Must Do (Highly Recommended)**

### 1. **Email Events Admin Page** ⭐⭐⭐
**Status:** Webhook ready, but no admin page to view events

**What to build:**
- Admin page: `/admin/emails` or `/admin/email-events`
- Show all email events (sent, delivered, opened, clicked, bounced)
- Filter by event type, date, recipient
- Link to related tickets
- Email delivery statistics

**Why important:**
- Track if customer emails are being delivered
- See which customers are engaging
- Identify bounced emails (invalid addresses)

**Files needed:**
- `app/admin/email-events/page.tsx` - Email events list page
- Update `app/admin/layout.tsx` - Add navigation link

### 2. **Run Database Migrations** ⭐⭐⭐
**Status:** Migration files created but may not be run

**Migrations to run in Supabase:**
1. `supabase/migrations/08_create_email_events_table.sql` - For email tracking
2. Verify all other migrations are applied

**How to check:**
- Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
- Run: `SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';`
- Should see: `tickets`, `admin_settings`, `blog_posts`, `email_events`

### 3. **Setup Resend Webhook** ⭐⭐⭐
**Status:** Code ready, but needs configuration

**Steps:**
1. Go to [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/dashboard) → Settings → Webhooks
2. Add webhook URL: `https://primeuaeservices.com/api/webhooks/resend`
3. Select all events
4. Copy signing secret
5. Add to Vercel environment variables: `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

**See:** `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SETUP.md` for detailed guide

## 🛠️ **Which One to Start With?**

**I recommend starting with:**

1. **Email Events Admin Page** - Most useful, webhook already ready
2. **Run Migrations** - Quick, ensures database is up to date
3. **Setup Webhook** - Quick configuration, enables tracking

**Want me to build any of these? Just tell me which one!** 🚀

---

## 📝 **Notes**

- All code is ready for webhook, just needs configuration
- Database migrations are created but need to be run
- Most features have partial implementation, just need completion
- Focus on Priority 1 items first for maximum impact
